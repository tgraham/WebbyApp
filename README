WebbyApp

Webby Manager on your Desktop

You can manage your webbies from your desktop.

You can manage multiple accounts, just add them and select the primary account you want to manage.
You can also turn on Global View in the Settings tab to view all the accounts you have listed.

Please let me know if you find any problems and I'll get them fix, or fork and submit a pull request. Please create a new branch.

You can download the compiled apps from here:

All OS's should be supported. Mobile app has been suggested, but I'll let feedback drive that request.
